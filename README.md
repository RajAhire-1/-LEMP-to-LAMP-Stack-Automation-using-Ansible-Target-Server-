# 🔄 LEMP to LAMP Stack Automation using Ansible (Target Server)

This project demonstrates how to **automate the migration from a LEMP stack to a LAMP stack** on a **target Amazon Linux server** using **Ansible**.

Instead of manually uninstalling and installing services, the entire process is handled through a single optimized Ansible playbook executed on a remote target server.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Ansible playbook performs the following actions on the target server:

- Removes **Nginx**
- Installs **Apache (httpd)**
- Installs **MariaDB**
- Installs **PHP and PHP-FPM**
- Stops and disables Nginx service
- Starts and enables Apache, MariaDB, and PHP-FPM services
- Deploys a sample `index.html` file to verify Apache setup

This simulates a **real-world DevOps migration scenario** where an existing web stack must be replaced safely and automatically.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Operating System:** Amazon Linux  
- **Automation Tool:** Ansible  
- **Web Server:** Apache (httpd)  
- **Database:** MariaDB  
- **Backend Language:** PHP, PHP-FPM  
- **Inventory Type:** Static inventory (`inventory.ini`)

## 📜 Ansible Playbook (`lemp_on_target.yml`)

This playbook is executed on a **remote target server** defined in the inventory file.

### Key Tasks Performed

- Package management using `dnf`
- Service control using `systemd_service`
- Conditional service handling using loops
- File deployment using the `copy` module

The playbook uses `become: yes` to perform system-level changes securely.

---

## 🖥️ Inventory File (`inventory.ini`)

The inventory file defines the target server and SSH access details:

```ini
[targetserver]
172.31.11.163 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/com.pem
````

This allows Ansible to connect securely to the remote EC2 instance.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Playbook

### 1️⃣ Verify Ansible Installation

```bash
ansible --version
```

### 2️⃣ Test Connectivity to Target Server

```bash
ansible -i inventory.ini targetserver -m ping
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini lemp_on_target.yml
```

---

## ✅ Verification

After successful execution, verify the setup:

* Apache service is running
* Nginx is removed and disabled
* MariaDB service is active
* PHP-FPM service is running
* Web page loads via Apache

Access the application in a browser:

```
http://<TARGET_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>/
```

---

## 🎯 Use Case

This project is useful for:

* Practicing Ansible with remote target servers
* Automating web stack migrations
* Learning service management with Ansible
* Understanding real-world DevOps automation workflows
* Showcasing configuration management skills on GitHub

---

## 📌 Summary

This project shows how Ansible can be used to **safely migrate an existing web stack** on a running server using automation instead of manual intervention.

It highlights:

* Idempotent configuration
* Remote server automation
* Clean and repeatable deployments
